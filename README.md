# Fire Propagation in cellular automata

After reviewing different models of forest fire propagation and how they can
exhibit chaotic behaviour, we used a cellular automaton acting on a 30x30 grid
to model a forest, inspired by the works of [Karafyllidis et al. 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3800(96)01942-4).

With a python script and a useful tkinter implementation of cellular automata.
